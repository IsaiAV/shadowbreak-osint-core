## üîç Common Setup Issues & Fixes

---

### ‚ùó Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shadowbreak'`

**What‚Äôs happening:**  
Python doesn‚Äôt recognize the local folder structure as a valid package path.

**Fix:**

From the root of the repo, set your Python path:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)

This makes sure Python can import from your local shadowbreak/ folder when running scripts like example_runner.py.

‚ùó Error: `Narrative drift test fails with 0.0 not greater than 0` 

What‚Äôs happening:

The test sentences used may be too semantically similar, producing no meaningful entropy difference.

Fix:

Edit the tests/test_entropy.py file to include more emotionally contrasting text examples.

Example:

t1 = "Everything is fine and calm."
t2 = "I can't sleep. I'm scared. They're watching me."

then rerun:

python3 -m unittest discover tests
